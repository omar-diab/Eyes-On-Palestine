                    <h3>What is the origin of the Jews?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Jews are the ones who turn to the Torah as evidence of their right to Palestine,
                        and the truth is that the Torah itself bears witness to the Palestinians's right to the land.
                        And The original Jews Prophet Abraham,peace be upon him. Our Prophet Ibrahim, peace be upon him,
                        came at the beginning of the second millennium before his appearance for safety,
                        fleeing from Iraq, and he came with a very small group, meaning that he had no intention of building a society or a state.
                        It is not, for example, that our Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him,
                        intended to build a homeland in Palestine and then went to Egypt with his children to his son,
                        our Prophet Joseph, peace be upon him. Their number at that time did not exceed 70 people.

                    <h3>What is the origin of the Palestinians?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Palestinians belong to the Canaanites, and they belong to a Semitic Arab people who immigrated from the Arabian Peninsula 
                        and resided in the Levant. The Canaanites, the sons of Prophet Shem, peace be upon him,
                        arrived from the Arabian Peninsula to Palestine in the period between 3000 BC. And 2500 BC. That is,
                        more than 500 years before the coming of our Prophet Abraham, peace be upon her.

                        They started come here for safety in 1830, when Europe started kill them and they called them dirty people.
                        Europe tried to destroy and killed them,
                        and after all of this Palestine was under UK control from 1922 to 1948.
                        Before the Uk gave them the power and guns to get the Palestine land, to expel them from their country.
